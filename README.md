## Setup & Run

First we need to build the angular application using the Angular CLI

```
cd angular-app
npm install
ng build
```

- Run the main server.

```
npm install
npm start
```

This launches a web-server running on http://localhost:1337

The `/` path serves the angular application.
The `/legacy` path serves the angularjs application.
